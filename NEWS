  Font Initialization
    . Force all font initialization to be name dependent
    . Font name / Font number can change as user installs or removes 
      fonts from the OS with potentially fatal impact on fldigi font usage.

      upload file is created
    . clear LOTWSDATE field if lotw rejects submission or fails to 
      respond within 25 seconds
    . insure that lotw review dialog closes on program exit
    . restore tabular sort order when adding a record

  Default Tx Audio
    . Change default audio output to both channels

  remove sprintf
    . change all remaining occurances of sprintf to snprintf

  Documentation update
    . New documentation for winkeyer interface

  n3fjp logger search
    . set initial search for n3fjp server to 5 second intervals

  fopen->fl_fopen
    . update to UDF-8 compatible fopen call

  48 bar macro
    . allow user to select above / below Rx/Tx panels

  CW decoder
    . Improved CW decoder
      - removed user adjustable signal level controls
      - added automatic tracking filters for Rx signal level
      - tracking filters change parameters with detected WPM.

  DX cluster
    . Update dxcluster QSY to correctly align signal to sweet spot
      when transceiver is in a CW mode.
    . add ability to respond to password prompt

  Logbook support
    . Add checkband test to new log entry before writing record
    . Added BAND control to log view, contest tab
      - fldigi does not use the BAND field, it is present as a
        convenience for exporting or importing from log programs
        that do use it.
      - the control is on the contest tab since that seems to be
        the most common use for BAND (e.g. field day event).
    . OS X file naming dialog drops the ".adif" extension.
      - add code to insure newlog etc have the correct extension.

      strings
      - <ZT> becomes <ZT:"%H%M%S">; <ZT:"%H:%M:%SZ"> etc.
      - <ZT:fmt> fmt is the strftime format string
        if the ':fmt' is not in the macro tag then the current format
        is used

  lotw addition
    . Add jt9 modes for lotw upload
    . Allow up to 7 numerals in frequency element

  THOR/IFKP Image transfers
    . Add auto save Rx images to
      - Thor
      - IFKP
    . Corrected IFKP send image sequencing
      - pic%[T] where T is image scale was not being sent before the
        image fascimille.
    . Added Thor and IFKP image transfer using the <IMAGE:fname> macro
      tag

  ifkp s/n update
    . Change to s/n measurement
      - noise measured over full range of possible signal bins
      - noise referenced to 3000 Hz bandwidth

      - noise measured over full range of possible signal bins
      - noise referenced to 3000 Hz bandwidth

  PSKMAIL PTT fault protection
    . add REQ(...) to show_tx_timer function call

      - discover and cull duplicates in both current and merge records
      - write duplicates to adif file for user review
      - annotate Rx Panel with user information on merger performance
