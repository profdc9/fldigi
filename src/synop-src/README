The "makefile" in this directory can be used to create a linux only
command line tool 'synop_tool.'

The make file is not named "Makefile" to avoid it being excluded by the
automake distribution scripts.  DO NOT rename this file.  You can simply
invoke "make" from within this directory and "make" will act upon the
makefile script.
